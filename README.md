# Machine Learning Notes - Obsidian Vault

[![Obsidian Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Obsidian-9B4FFF.svg)](https://obsidian.md) [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version%20Control-Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://git-scm.com/) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/)

## Overview

This repository contains my personal notes focused on Machine Learning concepts, primarily gathered while studying various resources, including the Machine Learning Specialization. The notes are created and managed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and version-controlled with Git/GitHub for backup and potential sharing.

## Contents

This vault currently includes notes on the following topics:

*   **Machine Learning Specialization:**
    *   [What is Machine Learning?](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/What%20is%20Machine%20Learning.md)
    *   [Cost Function](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/Cost%20Function.md)
    *   [Gradient Descent](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/Gradient%20Descent.md)
    *   [Linear Regression](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/Linear%20regression.md)
    *   [Supervised Learning](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/Supervised%20Learning.md)
    *   [Unsupervised Learning](Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/Unsupervised%20Learning.md)
    *   *(More topics will be added as studies progress)*

*   **Images:**
    *   Contains embedded images used within the notes.

*   **Obsidian Configuration (`.obsidian`):**
    *   Includes settings, plugins, themes, etc., for the Obsidian vault (excluding cache/workspace).

## How to Use

1.  **Browse on GitHub:** You can read the `.md` (Markdown) files directly in the GitHub interface. Images should render correctly.
2.  **Clone Locally:** Clone the repository to your local machine to have a copy of the notes.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imlakshayd/machine-learning-notes.git
    ```
3.  **Open as Obsidian Vault (Recommended):** For the best experience (linking, graph view, plugins), clone the repository and open the `machine-learning-notes` folder as an existing vault within your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application.

## Purpose

*   **Personal Learning:** To solidify understanding of Machine Learning concepts through note-taking.
*   **Backup:** To keep a secure backup of these notes.
*   **Version Control:** To track changes and evolution of the notes over time.
*   **Showcasing (Potential):** To demonstrate learning progress and note-taking practices.

## Future Plans

*   Continuously add notes covering more advanced ML topics, algorithms, and practical applications.
*   Refine and organize existing notes for clarity and accuracy.
*   Explore connections between different concepts using Obsidian's linking features.

Supervised learning is considered learning by example for computers. In supervised learning there are inputs (X) and outputs (Y), also know as features and labels respectively.

Some examples of supervised learning include:

| Input (X)                    | Output (Y)        | Applications       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| email                        | spam? (yes/no)    | spam filter        |
| audio                        | text transcripts  | speech recognition |
| date, historical tempreature | daily tempreature | weather prediction |

For the models they will all be trained on a dataset which has label (correct answers) and then can be trained to predict for input (X) which it hasn't seen before. 

There are various supervised learning algorithms some of the most popular which include:

- [[Support-vector machines]]
- [[Linear regression]]
- [[Logistic regression]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Linear discriminant analysis]]
- [[Decision trees]]
- [[k-nearest neighbors algorithms]]
- [[Neural networks]]
- [[Similarity learning]]

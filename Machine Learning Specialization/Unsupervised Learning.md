Unsupervised learning is considered when we have data with no labels. It is it computer's job to understand and organize the data in way or describe its structure and find patterns within it.

An example of unsupervised learning would be a clustering algorithm for example, within Google News, the algorithm within google news clusters keywords and related topics so you can filter by them. 



The common unsupervised learning approaches include:
- [[Clustering]]
- [[Association Rules]]
- [[Dimensionality reduction]]
- [[Anomaly Detection]]
